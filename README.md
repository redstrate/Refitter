# Refitter

Modify chest bones for specific gear.

This is a spiritual successor to my [VARC](https://xiv.zone/varc) mod, but done as a Dalamud plugin instead of my errenously editing model files by hand.

## Download

This plugin is currently available in [my personal Dalamud repository](https://github.com/redstrate/DalamudPlugins).

## Credits

Thanks to [RisaDev](https://github.com/RisaDev) and the contributors for [Customize+](https://github.com/Aether-Tools/CustomizePlus) which some of this code and theory is based on.
